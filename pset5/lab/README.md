# Lab 5: Inheritance

This program simulates the inheritance of blood types for each member of a family accross several generations.


## Implementation Details

* This version of the program shows the inheritance over 3 generations of a family.

    * The implementation can be easily changed to include any number of generations.

* Blood types for the root parents are created randomly.

* The program takes no inputs, neither through command-line arguments nor by prompting users.
    

## Usage

To run the compiled file, run `./inheritance` in the `lab` directory and the program's behaviour should be as per the examples below.


```
$ ./inheritance
Generation 0, blood type OO
    Generation 1, blood type AO
        Generation 2, blood type OA
        Generation 2, blood type BO
