# Mario

This program revisit Problem Set 1's Mario (less) and does the exact same thing, but this time in Python. Mario (less) simulates the right-aligned pyramid of blocks, which Mario must ascend, toward the end of World 1-1 in Nintendoâ€™s Super Mario Brothers.

However, this program recreates the pyramid in text, replacing each block with a hash `(#)`.


## Implementation Details

* The program prompts the user for the height of the pyramid.

    * The height must be a positive integer, inclusivly between 1 and 8; if not, the user will be re-prompted.

## Usage

To run the program, make sure to be in the `/mario/less` directory, execute `python3 mario.py` and the program's behaviour should be as per the examples below.

```
$ python3 mario.py
Height: 8
       #
      ##
     ###
    ####
   #####
  ######
 #######
########
```

```
$ python3 mario.py
Height: -1
Height: 0
Height: 42
Height: 50
Height: 4
   #
  ##
 ###
####
```
