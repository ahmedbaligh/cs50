# Cash

This program lets you minimize the number of coins (change) you’re dispensing for each customer, by informing you of the least number coins you may return for any amount of owed money.

The program **only** incoperates, and accordingly calculates based upon, four types of US coins: _quarters_ (25¢), _dimes_ (10¢), _nickels_ (5¢), and _pennies_ (1¢).


## Implementation Details

* The program prompts the user for the money owed and the user will be re-prompted, if they enter:

    * a non-numerical value.
    * a negative numerical value.
    * in an invalid form (eg. $4.63, 463), instead of in a valid one (eg. 4.63).


## Usage

To run the compiled file, run `./cash` in the `cash` directory and the program's behaviour should be as per the examples below.

```bash
$ ./cash
Change owed: 2.16
Coins: 11
```

```bash
$ ./cash
Change owed: -0.41
Change owed: foo
Change owed: 0.41
Coins: 4
```
