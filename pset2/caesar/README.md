# Caesar

This program allows users to encrypt messages using Caesarâ€™s cipher, which shifts each letter in the message by some number of places, which is the value of the key that the user inputs.

## Implementation Details

* The value of the key is entered as a second command-line argument when running the program.

* The program only accepts a single command-line argument that is also a non-negative integer, otherwise it will exit and output the following:

    * `missing command-line argument`, if no command-line argument was entered.
    
    * `too many command-line arguments`, if more than one command-line arguments were entered.

    * `Usage: ./caesar key`, if a non-negative integer was entered.

* The program prompts the user for plaintext, the text to be encrypted.

* The program prints the encrypted text, which has the following properties:

    * Non-alphabetic characters are not shifted and remain the same.

    * Alphabetical characters that exceed the letter `z` are not shifted to non-alphabetic characters, but rather rotated through the alphabet of their same case.

    * Case is preserved, no matter what the value of the key is: capitalized letters remain capitalized; lowercase letters remain lowercase.
    

## Usage

To run the compiled file, run `./caesar` in the `caesar` directory and the program's behaviour should be as per the examples below.

```bash
$ ./caesar 1
plaintext:  HELLO
ciphertext: IFMMP
```

```bash
$ ./caesar 13
plaintext:  hello, world
ciphertext: uryyb, jbeyq
```

```bash
$ ./caesar HELLO
Usage: ./caesar key
```

```
$ ./caesar 1 2 3
missing command-line argument
```

```
$ ./caesar
too many command-line arguments
```
